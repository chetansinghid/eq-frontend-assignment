# Repo for EQ frontend assignment

The code is for the front end compoenents for the chart, table and map visualizations for EQ API data.

## Some notes for EQ Team

### Note: 
The API data being fetched is from a glitch server hosting the updated code for eq assignment 1.
So, the intial fetch queries take time as the glitch server reloads the code.
This may result in performance lag for intial few queries.

### Note:
As per the stipulated deadline, the chart and table components have been completed. Map component was not
completed. The code completed for map has been left in the source files.
